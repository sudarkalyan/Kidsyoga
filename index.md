    <h3>Approaches</h3>
    <p><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education" target="blank">Montessori </a>and Kundalini Yoga teacher and teacher trainer Shakta Khalsa began to teach yoga to children in the 1970s, in a Kundalini community. She states that the approach is not "just a scaled-down version of yoga for adultsâ€”it's a whole different animal."[1] She taught asanas using simple descriptions: Downward Dog pose by getting the class to make the shape of a mountain, and Virabhadrasana by asking them to be "fearless warriors".[1] She led children into pranayama with breath-awareness exercises like blowing on a feather and noticing the different feelings that came when you blew hard or gently. She discovered that the teacher had to avoid even basic terms like "inhale" and "exhale" if the children didn't know those words.[1] In 1998 she published an early guide to children's yoga, Fly Like a Butterfly.</p>

<p>Marsha Wenig, founder of YogaKids International, has developed yoga sessions with videos suitable for children aged 3 to 6.[3] She agrees that the teaching methods are necessarily quite different from those used to teach adults. The benefits may be "stillness, balance, flexibility, focus, peace, grace, connection, health, and well-being"[4] but the challenge for the teacher is to hold the class's attention. She encourages children to "bark in the dog pose, hiss in the cobra, and meow in cat stretch."[4] Her experiences led to a 2003 book describing the methods that she developed.</p>
